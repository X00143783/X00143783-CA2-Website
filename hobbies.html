            Since I was a teenager I have been taking and processing black and
            white film. Give me a dark bathroom, some instant coffee and I can
            develop some film.

            I have written, directed, edited and recorded sound for a short film
            called Valentine that was seen in a variety of film festivals across
            Ireland.

            If I ever get the time to relax again, I would play some videogames.
            Last game I played was before starting University was Call Of Duty.
