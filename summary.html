  An enthusiastic and passionate individual with a huge interest in the software
  sector. I have recently completed my degree in Information Systems &
  Information Technology, part time and at night while working as an IT Support
  Technician. Previous to that I finished the Computer Science & Software
  Development Course at St Conlethâ€™s Community College with 9 Distinctions. I
  have developed strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills and I am able
  to google and use Chat-GPT to apply the information I need to complete tasks.
